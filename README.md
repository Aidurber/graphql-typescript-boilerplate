# GraphQL Typescript Boilerplate

I've been playing around with various GraphQL boilerplates like Vespa, rolled my own with Prisma, built on NestJS. I either found them too opinionated, or too verbose. I liked what Vespa and NestJS offered but found them having a lot of duplication.\*

This is based on:

- TypeORM
- Type-GraphQL

I write entities as I normally would in TypeORM and use Type-GraphQL to emit the GraphQL schema from those entities.

Perfect for getting up and running quickly.

This is a barebones boilerplate that I'll be using to test out ideas quickly.

**N.B**: I have nothing against Vespa, Nest, or Prisma (as a backend), I'm especially fond of Prisma but most times it's a little overkill.
